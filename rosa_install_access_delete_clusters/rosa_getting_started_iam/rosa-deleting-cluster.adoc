== Prerequisites

* If {product-title} created a VPC, you must remove the following items from your cluster before you can successfully delete your cluster:
** Network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections
** Any additional services that were added to the VPC

If these configurations and services remain, the cluster does not delete properly.
