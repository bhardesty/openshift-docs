= Troubleshooting VPC configuration for ROSA clusters

[role="_abstract"]
If your cluster fails to install, check common VPC configuration issues.

Consider the following troubleshooting items:

* Make sure your link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP option set] includes a domain name, and ensure that the domain name does not include any spaces or capital letters.
* If your VPC uses a custom DNS resolver (the `domain name servers` field of your DHCP option set is not `AmazonProvideDNS`), make sure it is able to properly resolve the private hosted zones configured in Route53.
